# week-6-forest-for-the-trees
<ol>
<li>Generate a random list of integers.<br/>
Show the binary heap tree resulting from inserting the integers on the list one at a time.</li>
<li>Using the list from the previous question, show the binary heap tree resulting from the list as a parameter to the buildHeap method.<br/> 
Show both the tree and list form.</li>
<li>Extend the <code>buildParseTree</code> function to handle mathematical expressions that do not have spaces between every character.</li>
<li>Extend the <code>buildParseTree</code> and evaluate functions to handle boolean statements. Remember that "not" is a unary operator, so this will complicate your code somewhat.</li>
  </ol>
